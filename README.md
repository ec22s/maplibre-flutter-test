# maplibre_demo

An example Flutter project demonstrating how to use the [MapLibre GL wrapper](https://github.com/m0nac0/flutter-maplibre-gl)
with clustering.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application, but is by no means a comprehensive guide
to all there is to know about Flutter MapLibre GL. Please refer to the project (linked above)
and the following resources for getting started with Flutter.

NOTE: You *will* need to set an API key in [map.dart](lib/map.dart). You can sign up for a free
Stadia Maps API key via our [Client Dashboard](https://client.stadiamaps.com/).

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Gotchas

There appear to be a few issues/inconsistencies between web and mobile. This repo is
currently tested against iOS and will have some quirks on Android and web as a result.
We have opened issues with the library to resolve these.
